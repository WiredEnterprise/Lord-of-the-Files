O senhor dos arquivos: Como o GitHub domesticou o Software Livre (E Mais)

[[SAN FRANCISCO — When the founders of GitHub moved into their swank South-of-Market loft last year, the first thing they did was redecorate. They turned the floor’s biggest office into a parody of an executive suite — complete with fake fireplace, plush leather chairs, and a wooden globe that slides open to reveal a bottle of single malt scotch. Hanging from the wall is a painting of a cat, dressed as Napoleon, with five octopus-like legs. They call it the Octocat.]]

SÃO FRANCISCO — Quando os fundadores do GitHub se mudaram para um loft ostentador no South-of-Market ano passado, a primeira coisa que fizeram foi redecorar. Eles transformaram o maior escritório do andar em uma suite executiva — com direito a lareira, cadeiras de couro peluciadas, e um globo de madeira que ao ser aberto revela uma garrafa de uísque de malte único. Na parede uma pintura de um gato, vestido como Napoleão, com pernas de polvo. Eles chamam de Octocat.


[[The point is that it’s not an executive suite. It’s a communal meeting room where anyone can hang out with anyone else, get some work done, and have a little fun at the same time.]]

O ponto é que não é uma suite executiva. É uma sala de reuniões onde qualquer um pode passar o tempo, trabalhar, e ter um momento de diversão ao mesmo tempo. 


[[“Everybody can bring their friends into that room and sort of impress them and stuff,” says Scott Chacon, GitHub’s CIO co-founder. You see, Chacon and CEO Chris Wanstrath and the rest of the executive team don’t have private offices. They work on the open floor next to the coders, glued to monitors with the rest of the staff, listening to LCD Soundsystem. Loud.]]

“Todos podem trazer seus amigos naquela sala e impressionar eles e tal,” diz Scott Chacon, CIO e co-fundador do GitHub. Veja que Chacon e o CEO Chris Wanstrath e o resto do time executivo não possuem escritórios privados. Eles trabalham em um andar aberto, perto dos desenvolvedores, colados a monitores com o resto do time, ouvindo LCD Soundsystem. Bem alto.


[[GitHub’s geektastic 14,000-square-foot loft mirrors its mission: to democratize computer programming. GitHub.com is best thought of as Facebook for geeks. Instead of uploading videos of your cat, you upload software. Anyone can comment on your code and add to it and build it into something better. The trick is that it decentralizes programming, giving everyone a new kind of control. GitHub has shaken up the way software gets written, making coding a little more anarchic, a little more fun, and a lot more productive.]]

O loft de 14mil metros quadrados do GitHub reflete a sua missão: democratizar a programação de computadores. GitHub.com pode ser visto como um Facebook para geeks. Ao invés de fazer upload de vídeos do seu gato, você faz upload de software. Qualquer um pode comentar o seu código fonte, alterar e ainda construir algo melhor em cima dele. O truque é que ele descentraliza a programação, dando a todos um novo tipo de controle. GitHub agitou a forma como software é escrito, fazendo a tarefa de codificação ficar mais anarquica, um pouco mais divertida, e bem mais produtiva. 

[[And the software world loves it. GitHub now has more than 1.3 million users, and over 2 million source code repositories — eight times the tally from just two years ago. If you count snippets of code and Wiki pages that are stored on the site, there are more than 4 million repositories. Two years ago, GitHub was a team of eight, holding company meetings in San Francisco cafes. By the beginning of 2011, they’d grown to 14 “hubbernauts” — as GitHub employees are affectionately called — and a year later, they’re at 57. In July, they took over the former digs of blogging outfit Six Apart. GitHub is growing fast — and it hasn’t taken a dime of venture funding.]]

E o mundo do software adora. O GitHub tem mais de 1.3 milhões de usuários, e mais de 2 milhões de repositórios de código — oito vezes maior que dois anos atrás. Se considerar pedaços de código e páginas de wiki que são armazenadas no site, são mais de 4 milhões de repositórios. Dois anos atrás, GitHub era um time com oito pessoas, que faziam reuniões em cafés de São Francisco. No início de 2011, o time cresceu para 14 “hubbernauts” — que é como os colaboradores do GitHub são chamados — e um ano depois, eles são 57. Em julho, eles assumiram as antigas instalações da empresa de blogs Six Apart. O GitHub está crescendo rápido — e não recorreu a nenhum centavo de fundos de investimento.

[[Once you’ve heard about GitHub, you start to see it almost everywhere. Sometimes, it’s hosting the code that underpins a big-name website. Other times, it’s driving a secret skunkworks project inside a Fortune 500 company. It has brought open source software that much closer to fulfilling its promise — but it doesn’t stop there. It’s also democratizing the creation of web pages and DNA analysis tools and maybe even the law of the land.]]

Uma vez que se escute falar sobre GitHub, voce começa a ver em praticamente todo lugar. Algumas vezes é por hospedar código de um grande website. Outras vezes, é por manter em segredo projetos de empresas listadas na Fortune 500. Fez com que o software livre ficasse mais parecido com o que se propõe - mas não para por aí. GitHub tambem (possui aplicativos) possibilita a democratização e criação de páginas web, aplicativos de análise de DNA e até mesmo sobre os gramados da terra.

[[“GitHub has changed the way that people approach development,” says Tom Preston-Werner, the company’s chief technology officer. “They realize that it doesn’t have to be so complex.”]]

"GitHub mudou a forma que as pessoas enxergam o desenvolvimento de software," diz Tom Preston-Werner, CTO do GitHub. "Eles perceberam que não precisa ser tão complicado."

[[Git Scratches Itch]]

Git Arranha a Coceira

[[Like so many other successful geek projects, GitHub began with coders scratching their own itch. About five years ago, Wanstrath and fellow programmer P.J. Hyett were both slinging code at Cnet, the tech news and reviews site. Their language of choice was Ruby on Rails, a programming framework that makes it easy to develop Web applications.]]

Assim como outros projetos de geeks que tivemos sucesso, o GitHub começou com desenvolvedores arranhando a própria coceira. Aproximadamente 5 anos atrás, Wanstrath e seu amigo programador P.J. Hyett estavam desenvolvendo na Cnet, o site de notícias e reviews de tecnologia. A linguagem de escolha deles foi Ruby e o framework Rails, que facilitava o desenvolvimento de aplicações Web.

[[As they built out their sites at Cnet, Wanstrath and Hyett wound up making a lot of improvements to Ruby on Rails itself. But they found it wasn’t so easy to get those changes integrated back into the open-source project. Following the then-dominant model of open source development, Rails was managed by a cadre of trusted coders who’d been given permission to “commit” changes to the project’s source code. To get one of their changes added to the central code, Wanstrath and Hyett would have to lobby one of those trusted coders and convince him that their change was worth integrating. That was often more work than writing the code in the first place.]]

[[They weren’t the only developers chafing under that Trusted Gatekeeper model of open source. A decade ago, Linus Torvalds found himself struggling to manage his role as gatekeeper of the Linux operating system he invented. In the beginning, Torvalds hosted Linux on a website belonging to the University of Helsinki. If people found a bug in the code, they’d send him a file with the changes via e-mail. If Torvalds read the e-mail and liked the changes, he’d incorporate them into Linux. But Torvalds is notorious for not reading all of his e-mail, so as the project got popular, more and more submissions were slipping through the cracks.]]

[[The Second Coming of Linus]]

The Second Coming of Linus

[[So in 2005, Torvalds created Git, version control software specifically designed to take away the busywork of managing a software project. Using Git, anybody can tinker with their own version of Linux — or indeed any software project — and then, with a push of a button, share those changes with Torvalds or anyone else. There is no gatekeeper. In practical terms, Torvalds created a tool that makes it easy for someone to create an alternative to his Linux project. In technical terms, that’s called a “fork”.]]

[[Back in the 1990s, forking was supposed to be a bad thing. It’s what created all of those competing, incompatible versions of Unix. For a while, there was a big fear that someone would somehow create their own fork of Linux, a version of the operating system that wouldn’t run the same programs or work in the same way. But in the Git world, forking is good. The trick was to make sure the improvements people worked out could be shared back with the community. It’s better to let people fork a project and tinker away with their own changes, than to shut them out altogether by only letting a few trusted authorities touch the code.]]

[[The old regime “makes it very hard to start radical new branches because you generally need to convince the people involved in the status quo up-front about their need to support that radical branch,” Torvalds says. “In contrast, Git makes it easy to just ‘do it’ without asking for permission, and then come back later and show the end result off — telling people ‘look what I did, and I have the numbers to show that my approach is much better.’”]]

[[It may have been built for Linux, but Git quickly proved to be a godsend for any large organization managing giant code bases. Today, Facebook, Staples, Verizon and even Microsoft are users. At Google, Git is so important that the company pays Junio Hamano – who took over the project from Torvalds – to work on Git fulltime, and also pays the salary for the project’s second-in-command, Shawn Pearce. ]]

Users can sign up for free and start contributing, but they pay money if they want to privately host code there — starting at $7 per month.

That starts at $5,000 per year, but can cost hundreds of thousands annually for companies with hundreds of coders.]]

BARRA LATERAL:

[[Why Git? It’s the British slang term for stupid, despicable person — arse. The joke “I name all my projects for myself, first Linux, then git” was just too good to pass up. But it is also short, easy-to-say, and type on a standard keyboard. And reasonably unique and not any standard command, which is unusual.–Linus Torvalds]]

Porque Git? É uma gíria inglesa para estúpido, pessoa desprezível - burra. A piada "Eu nomeio todos meus projetos para eu mesmo, primeiro Linux e agora git" era boa demais para deixar passar. Mas também é pequeno, fácil de dizer e digitar em um teclado padrão. E razoavelmente único e não é nenhum comando padrão, o que não é comum.-Linus Torvalds
